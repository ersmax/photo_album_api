      <q cite="https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2012/may/14/writers-no-longer-influenced-by-classics"> 
      After finding that authors of any given period are stylistically 
      similar to their contemporaries, they also discovered that the stylistic influence of
      the past is decreasing. While authors in the 18th and 19th centuries are still influenced by previous centuries,
      authors writing in the late 20th century are instead "strongly influenced" by writers from their own decade. "The so-called 'anxiety
      of influence', whereby authors are understood in terms of their response to canonical precursors, is becoming an 'anxiety of
      impotence', in which the past exerts a diminishing stylistic influence on the present, they write. This could, they suggest,
      be explained by the modernist movement, in which authors "reject their immediate stylistic predecessors yet remain a part of a dominant 
      movement that included many of their contemporaries.</q>

<!-- peer review accessibility report-->


<!--Guideline 1.1.1 – Non-text Content
According to the WCAG accessibility guidelines, all images have proper alt tags. Moreover, the form includes labels that aid the users to insert data. 
There is a hidden label in the form section related to the image uploading – under the URL submission – that has a proper alt tag that assist the user through assistive technology.
No other non-text content is present in the webpage (e.g. CAPTCHA, time-based media or tests).

Guideline 1.3 – Adaptable
According to G115, tag elements have been used with a purpose. For instance, the hyperlinks <a> in the navigation bar link to different sections of the webpage 
   according to their meaning and not because they appear appealing graphically: authors, contact us respectively. Another example is the following: the introduction 
   paragraph uses a review from the Guardian newspaper. Thus, the proper tag “cite” has been added. Additionally, background colour has been inserted for the box displaying 
   the authors and the footer to present main content and side content with a different visual presentation. 
For the guideline G117, a different font style was used in the footer – the section next to the map –  with the intention of convey another type of information: promotion and marketing.

Guideline 1.4 – Distinguishable
One of the elements that have been implemented, following the feedback of our reviewers, is the resizing of the text. Content now scales accordingly to the screen size up to 200% zoom. 
The content has been checked with different laptop screen sizes and different zoom (13”, 15”, 17” and 125%, 150%, 175% and 200%) (guideline 1.4.4).
It has also been added an amazing feature: the colour picker, a convenient mechanism that allows the user to change foreground and background colours, 
according to our peer reviewers (guideline 1.4.8).

Guideline 2.1 – Keyboard Accessible
The peer review has highlighted the conformability of the webpage to the guideline 2.1 and 2.4.
New features however have been added to improve the user experience.
Firstly, when the user is prompted to update the gallery, they are asked to fill different fields. The user can insert new information and close the modal without losing the added information. 
They can also close it with the Escape button (guideline 2.1). Secondly, if the user inserts a specific existing id of an image, the other fields are automatically filled with the remaining data, 
allowing the user to change them. Thirdly, it is possible to enlarge the images to read further details and most importantly the related interactive id. If the user wishes to change the image or 
associated fields, the only thing they have to do is clicking on the id so as to be redirected to update image form. Please note that all the fields related to the ID are already filled in.
Additionally, it is possible to filter the gallery with more than one tag at the same time either clicking on the full name of the famous person or using the search bar at the top right and pressing enter. 
For example, the user adds the tag “Ken Thompson”. Different images of Mr. Thompson appear. 
Now the user types “chess” in the search bar. The prior images are filtered and only those whose data (e.g. description, alt, tag, etc) contain the word “chess” are displayed. 
In addition, the user can add new tags by pressing the enter key. Please note that different tags are treated disjunctively. 

Guideline 2.4 – Navigable
Guideline principles 2.4.1 – 2.4.4 are being followed according to the peer review.

Incorporate our reviewers’ feedback on responsiveness
Different adjustments have been made to address the downsides highlighted in the peer review. The paragraph in the introduction now scales properly. 
The table is not used anymore. Therefore, all the scaling problems related to it have been solved automatically. The font size of the navbar, however, 
now fits properly to different screen sizes and the user interaction with the navbar is much more enjoyable. 
One new feature that the user may appreciate is the addition of the three buttons (add image, reset gallery and update gallery, respectively) that scale with the size of the screen.
